# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repository is organized as independent subprojects. Please:

- Create a topic branch from `master`.
- Keep changes focused and scoped to one subproject per PR when possible.
- Add or update tests when changing behavior.
- Follow existing code style (ESLint/Jest or Mocha/Chai/Sinon as applicable).
- Ensure `npm test` (and `npm run full-test` if available) passes before opening a PR.

## Development

- Install dependencies within the target subproject directory (`cd 0x.. && npm install`).
- Run tests locally before submitting changes.

## Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive messages. Reference files or tasks when helpful.

## Reporting Issues
