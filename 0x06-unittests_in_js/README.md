# Unit Tests in JS

Exercises focused on testing patterns with Mocha, Chai, and Sinon. Includes API testing exercises in subfolders (`8-api`, `9-api`, `10-api`).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+
- npm

### Install and run

```
npm install
npm test  # runs mocha
```

[!IMPORTANT]
API subprojects (`8-api`, `9-api`, `10-api`) have their own `package.json`. Install and test them separately from within each folder.
